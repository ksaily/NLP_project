# NLP_project

In this GitHub we provide our implementation for Hate Speech Detection as our coursework on the course Natural Language Processing and Text Mining.
You can find our code from the file NLP_project.ipynb.

NOTE: Please read the markdowns on the code because for example task number 7 requires the use of Linux and also you have to download additional code from GitHub.

We have also provided the datasets as well as the resulting datasets, which would be overwritten when running the code.
The beginning of task number 6&8 is commented out because the retrieval of tweets based on their ID takes a lot of time and therefore we have provided the SemTrain and SemTest2015 datasets in our uploads.
